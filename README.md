### 🤖 Agentic Workflows & AI
My recent focus is on the intersection of distributed systems and autonomous agents:
- **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw):** Active contributor and hobbyist developer of personal agentic frameworks. I'm currently building "Lil Sebastian," a highly personalized agent that manages my digital life, investment strategy, and family coordination.
- **Professional Focus:** Integrating agentic patterns into enterprise-grade backend systems to move beyond simple automation into true autonomous reasoning.

### 🏗️ Scalable Systems
- **10+ Years Experience:** Extensive background in Go, Kubernetes, and massive-scale ETL pipelines at companies like **Amazon**, **AWS**, and **IBM Cloud**.
- **Distributed Reliability:** Specialized in stabilizing critical infrastructure (like etcd operators) and optimizing cloud-native services for launch-scale performance.
- **Georgia Tech (MSCS):** Master's in Computer Science; long-time TA for Graduate Database Systems.
